# Django tutorial project - Meeting Planner
---

## Django project structure
---

A Django project is a big python package, which typically contains models, views, templates, and urls among others. A 
Django project also contains several `apps`, each of them itself is another child package of the main Django project 
package. It is a convention in the Django project to distribute the functionalities of the web application in to these 
smaller `apps`. In more advanced use cases, these `apps` can be reused by multiple Django projects, which is out of 
scope for this beginner project. Each of these `apps` should be small, easily defined unit of work, contributing to the 
main web application.

## Useful commands:
---

* `django-admin startproject meeting_planner` - To start a django project called meeting_planner.
* `python meeting_planner/manage.py runserver` - To start the django web server for the meeting_planner project in its 
initial form.

> Django by default runs the server in the debug mode i.e., in the `meeting_planner/meeting_planner/settings.py`,
> `DEBUG = True`. This is not advisable, when the app is deployed in the production.

> The `meeting_planner/meeting_planner/settings.py` file in this project encapsulates all the server settings for the 
> meeting_planner web application. For example, we change the `LANGUAGE_CODE` or `TIME_ZONE` used in the project.

## Files created by the startproject command and their purposes:
---

* `meeting_planner/manage.py` - Entry point for the project, which dispatches the commands like _runserver_ and 
_manage_ etc.
* `meeting_planner/db.sqlite3` - Created upon running the server to store the data models as relational tables.
* `meeting_planner/meeting_planner/asgi.py` - Needed for project deployment to production.
* `meeting_planner/meeting_planner/wsgi.py` - Needed for project deployment to production.
* `meeting_planner/meeting_planner/settings.py` - Customizes the project as per our needs.
* `meeting_planner/meeting_planner/urls.py` - Registers routes to the webserver.

## Phase I:
---

In the first phase, we add a simple page to the web application, by registering route and providing the respective 
handler function as a view.

* Create a Django app.
  * `python manage.py startapp website` - Creates an app called `website` inside the `meeting_planner` directory. It is
    a convention in Django to manage the parent web application in smaller set of units called **apps**. An app is 
    basically a Python package. This is supposed to create a file structure with the root directory name as `website` 
    inside the parent `meeting_planner` directory. For now, we'd remove everything, what were created leaving only 
    `__init__.py` and `views.py`. We'd do so to understand, what an **app** is, and how it fits inside a Django web 
    application.
  * Add the `website` in the list `INSTALLED_APPS` inside the `meeting_planner/meeting_planner/settings.py`, because 
    meeting_planner is the main Django web application, which we are building.
* Add a view function.
  * We go to the website app, and create a **view** inside the views.py. A view in Django handles the request to a web 
  page. In order to make simple page come into existence, we perform the following steps.
  * Add a handler function e.g., `welcome(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse` to the `website/views.py`.
* Register an url against the view function.
  * Register a path in the `meeting_planner/urls.py` in the `urlpatterns` list as `path('welcome.html', welcome)`, 
  which adds a path string _welcome.html_ and registers `welcome` function as the respective handler of the 
  request received in this path. And then upon running the server, the path is served.
  * We also can register the handler function for the homepage in the same way, where we'd register the path to be 
  something like `path('', home)`.
* Run server and view the page.

## Phase II:
---

In the second phase, we deal with capability of Django to implement the object relational mapping as well as database 
migration. We don't go deep into the concept of migration, and limit our scope of this project to the initial migration 
to set up the database.

Model is the Python class, which gets translated to a relational table, and objects get translated as the rows of the 
respective table. Once class object can have reference of the other class object. Hence, Django has utilities for 
maintaining those as foreign key relationships. However, in this project we won't go too deep into that.

Migration comes into play, when some of our table schemas change. From the relation database point of view, this is a 
DDL change. This may happen, when we add / remove / modify one or more attributes of the Python object. Then we have 
to make the respective changes in the columns of the respective table. These changes are handled by migration. When 
such a change becomes necessary, a migration script is generated by Django to enforce the required change in the 
database. However, when we deal with very complex relational schemas, Django often can not handle those migration 
situations by itself, and in those cases we need to provide custom migration strategies. In this project we won't deal 
with such situations.

As a starting point, we see in the `meeting_planner` 

* Create Django model
* Create and run database migration
* Edit data with Django admin interface
